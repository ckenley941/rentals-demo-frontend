# App Creation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
A few external dependencies were added to improve the App such as Material UI and Axios

## Running the App

`npm start` runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Things Done In a Week

If I had a week then I would improve my Rental Card to display more information in different tabs depending on the relevant subject. I would also like to make the API more secure and provide more querying capabilities but since it is an external API out of my control this would not have been possible.

#### App Functionality

The App pulls rental data from an API endpoint https://search.outdoorsy.com/rentals with the ability to filter on certain keywords and to change page offset and limit. The UI automatically updates the data returned based on the filtering.
